# Flask React Project

This is the backend for the Flask React project. The project utilizes React.js for the frotend.

# Introduction and Features

This project serves as a clone of the popular online vacation rental marketplace platform, Airbnb, with a scary twist. The online listings for this clone are real sites and landmarks that are claimed to haunted and subject to paranormal activity, thus the name, Scarebnb. Similar to Airbnb, this clone has the following features:

- Listings. Users can browse listings that are thought to be haunted and read detailed descriptions of each individual listing.
- Bookings. Users can book a vacation at the haunted domain of their choice. Provided that the venue has the necessary vacancies.
- Search Listings. Users can search for listings through the Google Maps API.
- Reviews. Reviews and a ghostly star rating can be created for each listing by a registered user.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository (only this branch)

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/appacademy-starters/python-project-starter.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies

      ```bash
      pipenv install --dev -r dev-requirements.txt && pipenv install -r requirements.txt
      ```

3. Create a **.env** file based on the example with proper settings for your
   development environment
4. Setup your PostgreSQL user, password and database and make sure it matches your **.env** file

5. Get into your pipenv, migrate your database, seed your database, and run your flask app

   ```bash
   pipenv shell
   ```

   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```

   ```bash
   flask seed all
   ```

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

6. To run the React App in development, checkout the [README](./react-app/README.md) inside the `react-app` directory.

***
*IMPORTANT!*
   If you add any python dependencies to your pipfiles, you'll need to regenerate your requirements.txt before deployment.
   You can do this by running:

   ```bash
   pipenv lock -r > requirements.txt
   ```

*ALSO IMPORTANT!*
   psycopg2-binary MUST remain a dev dependency because you can't install it on apline-linux.
   There is a layer in the Dockerfile that will install psycopg2 (not binary) for us.

## Deploy to Heroku

1. Create a new project on Heroku
2. Under Resources click "Find more add-ons" and add the add on called "Heroku Postgres"
3. Install the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line)
4. Run

   ```bash
   heroku login
   ```

5. Login to the heroku container registry

   ```bash
   heroku container:login
   ```

6. Update the `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` variable in the Dockerfile.
   This should be the full URL of your Heroku app: i.e. "https://flask-react-aa.herokuapp.com"
7. Push your docker container to heroku from the root directory of your project.
   This will build the dockerfile and push the image to your heroku container registry

   ```bash
   heroku container:push web -a {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP}
   ```

8. Release your docker container to heroku

   ```bash
   heroku container:release web -a {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP}
   ```

9. set up your database:

   ```bash
   heroku run -a {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP} flask db upgrade
   heroku run -a {NAME_OF_HEROKU_APP} flask seed all
   ```

10. Under Settings find "Config Vars" and add any additional/secret .env variables.
